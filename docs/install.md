# Installation

The Flux Kluctl Controller requires an existing [Flux installation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/) on the
same cluster that you plan to install the Flux Kluctl Controller to.

## kustomize
After Flux has been installed, you can install the Flux Kluctl Controller by running the following command:

```sh
kustomize build "https://github.com/kluctl/flux-kluctl-controller/config/install?ref=v0.8.1" | kubectl apply -f-
```

## Helm
A Helm Chart for the controller is also available [here](https://github.com/kluctl/charts/tree/main/charts/flux-kluctl-controller).
To install the controller via Helm, run:
```shell
$ helm repo add kluctl https://kluctl.github.io/charts
$ helm install flux-kluctl-controller kluctl/flux-kluctl-controller
```

## Flux Alerts
_NOTE: To set up Flux Alerts from KluctlDeployments you will need to patch the enum in the Alerts CRD.
There is a [patch](../config/patch/alerts-crd-patch.yaml) included in this repository that can do this for you. You can apply it directly or include the [yaml](../config/patch/alerts-crd-patch.yaml) version in `gotk-patch.yaml` with your `flux bootstrap`.
You can also add something like the following to your cluster's `kustomization.yaml`:_

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- gotk-components.yaml
- gotk-sync.yaml
patchesJson6902:
- target:
    group: apiextensions.k8s.io
    version: v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    name: alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io
  path: 'alerts-crd-patch.yaml' # The downloaded patch in your flux repository

```


## CLI support

Currently kluctl cli supports experimental subcommands to interact with KluctlDeployment Objects and it's source. <br>

You can install kluctl cli following the guideline [here](https://kluctl.io/docs/installation/).

Usage guidelines can be found [here](https://kluctl.io/docs/reference/commands/flux/).
